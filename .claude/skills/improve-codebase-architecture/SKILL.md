# Improve Codebase Architecture

Surface architectural friction and propose **deepening opportunities** — refactors that turn shallow modules into deep ones. The aim is testability and AI-navigability.

This command is _informed_ by the project's domain model and built on a shared design vocabulary:

- Run the `/codebase-design` skill for the architecture vocabulary (**module**, **interface**, **depth**, **seam**, **adapter**, **leverage**, **locality**) and its principles (the deletion test, "the interface is the test surface", "one adapter = hypothetical seam, two = real"). Use these terms exactly in every suggestion — don't drift into "component," "service," "API," or "boundary."
- The domain language in `docs/vision/glossary.md` and the canonical-vocabulary table in `CLAUDE.md` gives names to good seams; the ADRs in `decisions/` record decisions this command should not re-litigate. **Kafoo has no `CONTEXT.md` and will not gain one** — one name per concept, in one file (`CLAUDE.md`, "Canonical vocabulary").

## Process

### 1. Explore

**Scope before you scan — YAGNI.** Deepening a module pays off by making future changes to it easier, so put extra weight on the parts of the codebase that have recently changed. Decide *where* to look before you look:

- If the user named a direction — a module, a subsystem, a pain point — take it, and skip the inference below.
- Otherwise, walk back a good stretch of the commit history (`git log --oneline`) to find the codebase's hot spots — the files and areas that keep coming up — and let those paths pull your attention first. If the changes are scattered with no clear hot spot, widen the net.

Read the project's domain glossary (`docs/vision/glossary.md`, `docs/product/domain-model.md`) and any ADRs in `decisions/` covering the area you're touching first.

Then spawn a sub-agent to walk the codebase. Don't follow rigid heuristics — explore organically and note where you experience friction:

- Where does understanding one concept require bouncing between many small modules?
- Where are modules **shallow** — interface nearly as complex as the implementation?
- Where have pure functions been extracted just for testability, but the real bugs hide in how they're called (no **locality**)?
- Where do tightly-coupled modules leak across their seams?
- Which parts of the codebase are untested, or hard to test through their current interface?

Apply the **deletion test** to anything you suspect is shallow: would deleting it concentrate complexity, or just move it? A "yes, concentrates" is the signal you want.

### 2. Present candidates as an HTML report

Write a self-contained HTML file to the scratchpad directory so nothing lands in the repo.

**Kafoo sessions have no display, so `xdg-open` opens nothing.** Publish the file as an Artifact instead and give the founder the link — a hosted page he can read on a phone. Two consequences for the scaffold in `HTML-REPORT.md`: drop the `<!doctype>`/`<html>`/`<head>`/`<body>` wrapper (the Artifact host supplies it, keep only a `<title>`), and **inline the CSS and the Mermaid diagrams' styling rather than loading Tailwind or Mermaid from a CDN** — a strict content-security policy blocks every external host, so a CDN `<script>` renders a blank page. Mermaid itself still works: Artifacts render `<pre class="mermaid">` blocks natively, with no library to load.

The report uses **Tailwind via CDN** for layout and styling, and **Mermaid via CDN** for diagrams where a graph/flow/sequence reliably communicates the structure. Mix Mermaid with hand-crafted CSS/SVG visuals — use Mermaid when relationships are graph-shaped (call graphs, dependencies, sequences), and hand-built divs/SVG when you want something more editorial (mass diagrams, cross-sections, collapse animations). Each candidate gets a **before/after visualisation**. Be visual.

For each candidate, render a card with:

- **Files** — which files/modules are involved
- **Problem** — why the current architecture is causing friction
- **Solution** — plain English description of what would change
- **Benefits** — explained in terms of locality and leverage, and how tests would improve
- **Before / After diagram** — side-by-side, custom-drawn, illustrating the shallowness and the deepening
- **Recommendation strength** — one of `Strong`, `Worth exploring`, `Speculative`, rendered as a badge

End the report with a **Top recommendation** section: which candidate you'd tackle first and why.

**Use CONTEXT.md vocabulary for the domain, and the `/codebase-design` vocabulary for the architecture.** If `CONTEXT.md` defines "Order," talk about "the Order intake module" — not "the FooBarHandler," and not "the Order service."

**ADR conflicts**: if a candidate contradicts an existing ADR, only surface it when the friction is real enough to warrant revisiting the ADR. Mark it clearly in the card (e.g. a warning callout: _"contradicts ADR-0007 — but worth reopening because…"_). Don't list every theoretical refactor an ADR forbids.

See [HTML-REPORT.md](HTML-REPORT.md) for the full HTML scaffold, diagram patterns, and styling guidance.

Do NOT propose interfaces yet. After the file is written, ask the user: "Which of these would you like to explore?"

### 3. Grilling loop

Once the user picks a candidate, walk the decision tree with them one question at a time — constraints, dependencies, the shape of the deepened module, what sits behind the seam, what tests survive. (Upstream calls a `/grilling` skill here; **it is not published in the source repository**, so run the questioning yourself rather than looking for a file that does not exist.)

Side effects happen inline as decisions crystallize — keep the domain model current as you go. Kafoo has no `/domain-modeling` skill installed; `CLAUDE.md` already binds you to the same discipline (definition of done, item 7):

- **Naming a deepened module after a concept not in the glossary?** Add the term to `docs/vision/glossary.md` and, if it is a concept the whole codebase must name consistently, the canonical-vocabulary table in `CLAUDE.md`. Update `docs/product/domain-model.md` in the same commit if the domain changed.
- **Sharpening a fuzzy term during the conversation?** Update the glossary right there.
- **User rejects the candidate with a load-bearing reason?** Offer an ADR in `decisions/`, framed as: _"Want me to record this as an ADR so future architecture reviews don't re-suggest it?"_ Only offer when the reason would actually be needed by a future explorer to avoid re-suggesting the same thing — skip ephemeral reasons ("not worth it right now") and self-evident ones.
- **A candidate touches authorization, money, personal data, or an AI write path?** It is not a pure refactor. `CLAUDE.md`'s stop-and-ask triggers and the review agents in `.claude/agents/` still apply — deepening a module is never a reason to move an RLS policy or an approval gate.
- **Want to explore alternative interfaces for the deepened module?** Run the `/codebase-design` skill and use its design-it-twice parallel sub-agent pattern.
